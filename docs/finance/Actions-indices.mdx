  # 1. Actions & Indices  
**Definition**  
An action (stock) represents a fraction of ownership in a company. Shareholders may receive **dividends**, which are distributions of corporate profits.

**Dividend Types**
- **Discrete dividends**: Fixed amounts paid on specific dates (e.g. â‚¬2 per share on ex-dividend date).  
- **Continuous dividend yield $$q$$**: Modeled as a constant proportional yield, simplifying option and forward pricing.

### Why Dividend Yields Matter
The **dividend yield** is a fundamental component of an indexâ€™s **forward pricing** and **total return** dynamics.  
A higher yield means investors receive more cash flow from dividends â€” but it also means that, **under risk-neutral pricing**, the **forward price is discounted** more heavily:

$$
F_t^{index}(T) = S_t \, e^{(r - q_{index})(T-t)} ,
$$

where:
- $$ S_t $$: current index level  
- $$ r $$: risk-free rate  
- $$ q_{index} $$: aggregate dividend yield (weighted average across constituents)  

A higher $$ q_{index} $$ â‡’ lower $$ F_t^{index} $$.  
Hence, EuroStoxx and CAC forwards trade below spot, while Nasdaqâ€™s lower yield keeps forwards closer to spot.


### Forward vs Spot under Dividend Yields

> Forward on an index with dividends:  
> $$ F_t^{\text{index}}(T) = S_t \, e^{(r - q)(T-t)}. $$

- If $$q < r$$: $$F > S$$ (carry positive)  
- If $$q \approx r$$: $$F \approx S$$  
- If $$q > r$$: $$F < S$$ (dividends dominate)

### ðŸŸ¡ EuroStoxx 50
- Represents 50 of the largest **Eurozone blue-chip companies** (e.g. TotalEnergies, LVMH, Siemens).  
- Dividend yield around **3â€“3.5%**, reflecting Europeâ€™s high payout culture.  
- Published as:
  - **Price Index:** excludes dividends.  
  - **Total Return Index:** assumes reinvestment of dividends.  
- Often used in **structured products** and **volatility trading**, as its stable yield simplifies modeling.

Mathematically, for dividend-corrected pricing:
$$
S_t^{TR} = S_t^{Price} \, e^{q_{index}(T-t)}
$$
where the total return index outperforms the price index by the cumulative dividend yield.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ CAC 40
- Franceâ€™s 40 largest listed firms (BNP Paribas, Airbus, Lâ€™OrÃ©al, etc.), **capitalization-weighted**.  
- Typical dividend yield ~3.5%, but fluctuates with **sector rotation** and **payout ratios**.  
- Strongly cyclical: yields tend to rise in downturns as prices fall.  
- **Forward discount** is comparable to EuroStoxx:
<br/>

$$
\frac{F_{CAC}}{S_{CAC}} \approx e^{(r - q_{CAC})(T-t)} \Rightarrow \text{~1.5\%â€“2.5\% below spot annually.}
$$

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Nasdaq 100
- Comprises 100 largest **non-financial U.S. tech-oriented stocks** (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA).  
- Dividend yield extremely low (~0.9%) due to **growth focus** and **share buybacks** replacing dividends.  
- Forward curve nearly **flat to spot** because $$ q_{Nasdaq} \approx r $$.  
- During bull markets, this creates **positive carry** for index futures buyers.

---

### Comparative View
| Index | Dividend Yield | Typical Forward Discount | Dominant Sectors | Comments |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **EuroStoxx 50** | 3.2% | -2% to -3% vs Spot | Financials, Industrials | Stable dividend culture, low buybacks |
| **CAC 40** | 3.5% | -2% to -3% | Energy, Luxury, Banks | High French dividend payout ratios |
| **Nasdaq 100** | 0.9% | â‰ˆ0% | Tech, Consumer Discretionary | Low yield, strong buyback bias |
| **S&P 500** | 1.6% | -0.5% | Broad Market | Balanced income/growth mix |

## 3. Forwards on Dividend-Paying Assets {#forwards-on-dividends}

### General Formula

- **With continuous dividend yield $$q$$:**
  $$
  F_t^{fwd}(T) = S_t \, e^{(r - q)(T-t)}.
  $$

- **With discrete dividends $$\{D_i\}$$ before $$T$$:**
  $$
  F_t^{fwd}(T) = \big(S_t - \text{PV}_t[\text{dividends}]\big) \, e^{r(T-t)}.
  $$

Where:
- $$S_t$$ = spot price  
- $$r$$ = risk-free rate  
- $$\text{PV}_t[\text{dividends}]$$ = present value of dividends paid before maturity  

---

## 4. Dividends and Option Pricing {#dividends-and-options}


Dividends **shift the forward price downwards**, which has opposite effects on options:

- **Call options**: Lose value, since the forward decreases.  
- **Put options**: Gain value, since downside probability increases.  

---

## 5. Numerical Example

Suppose:
- Spot price $$S_0 = 100$$,  
- Risk-free rate $$r = 2\%$$,  
- Dividend yield $$q = 3\%$$,  
- Maturity $$T = 1$$ year.  

Then:
$$
F_0^{fwd}(1) = 100 \, e^{(0.02 - 0.03)} = 99.0
$$

The forward trades **below spot** because the dividend yield exceeds the risk-free rate.

---

## 6. Practical Applications

- **Dividend forecasts** are essential in pricing structured products (e.g. autocallables, barriers).  
- **Dividend swaps** exist to hedge dividend exposure separately from index exposure.  
- **Index forwards** (e.g. EuroStoxx, CAC) almost always price below spot due to positive dividend yields.

---

## 7. Interview Practice

**Q1. Why are equity index forwards typically below spot?**  
Because dividends reduce the forward: the expected dividend yield outweighs the financing cost.  

**Q2. How does continuous vs discrete dividend modeling change the formula?**  
- Continuous yield $$q$$: Exponential adjustment.  
- Discrete: Subtract present value of fixed dividend payments.  

**Q3. Why do dividends reduce call values but increase put values?**  
Calls are sensitive to higher forwards (dividends push them down), while puts benefit from lower forwards.  

---

---

## 8. Equity Market Mechanics

Equities represent **claims on future cash flows**, while indices are **weighted portfolios** of these claims.  
Each stock contributes to the **index level** proportionally to its market capitalization:

$$
I_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i S_t^{(i)}}{D_t}
$$

Where:
- $$S_t^{(i)}$$ = stock price  
- $$w_i$$ = float-adjusted weight  
- $$D_t$$ = index divisor ensuring continuity through corporate actions  

**Corporate events** (dividends, splits, rights issues) cause mechanical adjustments to $$D_t$$ to avoid artificial jumps.

---

## 9. Index Forwards and Dividend Curves

Forwards on equity indices incorporate **expected dividends** over the maturity horizon.

$$
F_t^{index}(T) = S_t e^{(r - q_{impl}(T))(T-t)}
$$

Here $$q_{impl}(T)$$ is the **implied dividend yield curve**, extracted from index futures.  
It is **term-dependent**, decreasing for short maturities (front-loaded dividends) and flattening for longer maturities.

<div style={{background:'#111', padding:'1rem', borderRadius:'10px', border:'1px solid gold'}}>
  <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
  EuroStoxx50 implied dividend yield (as of Jan 2025):  
  1Y â‰ˆ 3.2% â€¢ 2Y â‰ˆ 3.0% â€¢ 5Y â‰ˆ 2.6% â€¢ 10Y â‰ˆ 2.4%
</div>

---

## 10. Dividend Futures and Implied Dividends

**Dividend futures** isolate the dividend component from the index price.  
They settle on the **sum of dividends** paid by index constituents over a calendar year:

$$
\text{FutDiv}(T) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_T} D_i
$$

They are used to:
- Hedge **dividend exposure** in structured products  
- Express **macro views** on corporate payout cycles  
- Arbitrage against **index futures** via synthetic replication  

Relation between index forward and dividend future:

$$
F^{index} = (S - PV_{div}) e^{rT} \quad \Rightarrow \quad PV_{div} = S - F^{index} e^{-rT}
$$

---

## 11. Impact of Dividends on Options

Option pricing integrates the **dividend yield** through the forward.  
For a **call option**:

$$
C = S e^{-qT} N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
$$

For a **put option**:

$$
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S e^{-qT} N(-d_1)
$$

where:
$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r - q + 0.5\sigma^2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}, \quad
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T}
$$

Thus, increasing $$q$$ â†’ lowers calls, raises puts.  
Index skews arise partly from the **asymmetry of dividend uncertainty**.

---

## 12. Stochastic Dividend Yield Models (Advanced)

In reality, dividends evolve stochastically.  
A simple model assumes:

$$
dq_t = \kappa(\bar{q} - q_t)dt + \sigma_q dW_t^q
$$

This yield process can be correlated with volatility and equity price, affecting both the **forward curve** and **vol surface**.

---

## 13. Empirical Observation: Index vs Single Stock Volatility

| Aspect | Single Stocks | Indices |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Volatility Level** | Higher (idiosyncratic risk) | Lower (diversification) |
| **Skew Steepness** | Flatter | Steeper (systemic risk) |
| **Dividend Certainty** | Variable | Aggregated, smoother |
| **Forward Curve** | Close to spot | Discounted due to aggregate dividends |

---

## 15. Takeaways

- **Dividends** anchor the gap between **spot** and **forward**.  
- **Index skews** reflect collective downside protection demand.  
- **Dividend futures** reveal forward expectations of payouts.  
- For quantitative roles, being able to derive $$F_t^{fwd}(T)$$ and link it to option pricing is crucial.
