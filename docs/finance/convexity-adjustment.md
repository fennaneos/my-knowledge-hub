# üîÄ Forwards vs Futures & Convexity Adjustment

Forwards and futures look very similar: both are agreements to buy/sell an asset in the future at a fixed price.  
But the **timing of cash flows** creates a subtle ‚Äî and important ‚Äî difference when interest rates are stochastic.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Forward Contracts

A **forward contract** signed at time $$t$$ with maturity $$T$$:

- Obliges the long to **buy** the asset at $$T$$ for the forward price $$F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T)$$.  
- No cash flow at initiation.  
- Payoff at maturity:

$$
V_T^{\text{fwd}} = S_T - F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T).
$$

**Pricing (no dividends):**

By replication (cash-and-carry arbitrage):

$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) = S_t \, e^{r (T-t)}.
$$

With continuous dividend yield $$q$$:

$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) = S_t \, e^{(r - q)(T-t)}.
$$

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Futures Contracts

A **futures contract** is similar to a forward, but:

- It is standardized and traded on an exchange.  
- Gains and losses are **settled daily (mark-to-market)** via margin accounts.  
- At maturity $$T$$, the payoff is the same as a forward:

$$
V_T^{\text{fut}} = S_T - F_t^{\text{fut}}(T).
$$

But unlike forwards, the intermediate daily cash flows matter.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Difference

- **Forward:** One cash flow at maturity.  
- **Future:** A sequence of daily settlements.

If interest rates are **deterministic**, both contracts have the same fair price:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}}(T) = F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T).
$$

If rates are **stochastic**, they differ ‚Äî because the cash flows from futures can be reinvested at random interest rates.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Mathematical Framework

### Forward Price under Risk-Neutral Measure

Under the risk-neutral measure $$\mathbb{Q}$$, with num√©raire $$B_t = e^{\int_0^t r_s \, ds}$$:

$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) = \frac{1}{P(t,T)} \, \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T],
$$

where $$P(t,T)$$ is the zero-coupon bond price.

### Futures Price under Futures Measure

Under the **futures measure** $$\mathbb{Q}^{\text{fut}}$$, with num√©raire $$1$$ (the money-market account rebalanced daily), the futures price is:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}}(T) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^{\text{fut}}}[S_T].
$$

:::info üîé Futures Measure Explained

When we price forwards and futures, the key difference comes from the **measure** under which the asset price is a martingale.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Risk-Neutral Measure (forwards)

- **Num√©raire:** Money-market account  
  $$ B_t = e^{\int_0^t r_s \, ds} $$  

- Under the risk-neutral measure $$ \mathbb{Q} $$:  

$$
\frac{S_t}{B_t} \quad \text{is a martingale}.
$$

- Forward price:  

$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) = \frac{1}{P(t,T)} \, \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T],
$$

where $$ P(t,T) $$ is the zero-coupon bond price.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Daily Settlement in Futures

Futures contracts are **marked-to-market daily**:

- Gains and losses are realized each day.  
- They are immediately reinvested at that day‚Äôs short rate.  
- This changes the timing of cash flows compared to forwards.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Futures Measure $$ \mathbb{Q}^{fut} $$

We define a new measure so that:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}}(T) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^{\text{fut}}}[S_T].
$$

- Under this measure, the **futures price is a martingale without discounting**.  
- People often say its *‚Äúnum√©raire is 1‚Äù* because you no longer divide by $$B_t$$.  
  The effect of discounting is absorbed by daily settlement.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Link to Convexity Adjustment

The relationship between forwards and futures can be expressed as:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}}(T) - F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T)
= \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}\!\Big(S_T, \tfrac{B_t}{B_T}\Big).
$$

- If $$S_T$$ is **positively correlated** with interest rates ‚Üí futures price is higher.  
- If **negatively correlated** ‚Üí futures price is lower.  

---

### ‚úÖ Intuition

- **Forwards:** One settlement at $$T$$ ‚Üí need discounting under risk-neutral measure.  
- **Futures:** Many settlements along the way ‚Üí no discounting needed, so futures price is a martingale under its own measure.  
- That‚Äôs why we use the shorthand: *‚Äúnum√©raire = 1‚Äù*.

:::


---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Convexity Adjustment

The difference between futures and forwards comes from the change of measure:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}}(T) - F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T)
= \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}} \Big( S_T , \frac{B_t}{B_T} \Big).
$$

This is called the **convexity adjustment**.

- If $$S_T$$ is **positively correlated** with interest rates, the covariance is positive ‚Üí futures price is higher than forward.  
- If $$S_T$$ is **negatively correlated**, the futures price is lower.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Approximate Formula

Suppose the underlying follows:

$$
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu \, dt + \sigma_S \, dW_t^S, \quad
dr_t = \theta \, dt + \sigma_r \, dW_t^r,
$$

with correlation $$\rho$$ between Brownian motions.

Then, under some approximations (Hull‚ÄìWhite model for rates), the convexity adjustment is:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}}(T) \approx F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) \, \exp\Big( \tfrac{1}{2} \, \sigma_S \, \sigma_r \, \rho \, (T-t)^2 \Big).
$$

This correction term reflects the joint volatility of the asset and interest rates.

:::info
## üîé Deriving the Convexity Adjustment Intuition

Suppose the underlying asset and the short rate follow correlated stochastic processes:

$$
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu \, dt + \sigma_S \, dW_t^S,
\qquad
dr_t = \theta \, dt + \sigma_r \, dW_t^r,
$$

with correlation:

$$
dW_t^S \, dW_t^r = \rho \, dt.
$$

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Forward Price Definition

The **forward price** under the $T$-forward measure is:

$$
F_t^{fwd}(T) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[S_T].
$$

This expectation uses the **discount bond $P(t,T)$** as num√©raire, so the drift of $S_t$ is adjusted accordingly.

:::note
## üìå Forward as a Martingale under the $$T$$-Forward Measure

We show that the forward price process $$F_u^{\text{fwd}}(T)_{u \le T} $$ is a **martingale** under the $$T$$-forward measure $$ \mathbb{Q}^T $$. In particular,
$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}\!\big[F_T^{\text{fwd}}(T)\big].
$$

---

### 1) Pricing with the $$T$$-bond num√©raire

Let $$P(t,T)$$ be the price at time $$t$$ of a zero-coupon bond maturing at $$T$$.
Under the $$T$$-forward measure $$ \mathbb{Q}^T $$ (num√©raire $$P(\cdot,T)$$), any payoff $$X_T$$ delivered at $$T$$ has time-$$t$$ price
$$
V_t \;=\; P(t,T)\,\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[\,X_T\,].
$$

---

### 2) Forward price as normalized $$T$$-claim on $$S_T$$

The $$T$$-maturity **forward price** on the asset is the price today of receiving $$S_T$$ at $$T$$, **normalized by** the $$T$$-bond:
$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T)
\;\equiv\;
\frac{V_t(\text{deliver }S_T)}{P(t,T)}
\;=\;
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[\,S_T\,].
$$

More generally, at any $$u \in [t,T]$$:
$$
F_u^{\text{fwd}}(T) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_u^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[\,S_T\,].
$$

---

### 3) Martingale property (tower rule)

For $$t \le u \le T$$, apply iterated expectations under $$ \mathbb{Q}^T $$:
$$
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}\!\big[F_u^{\text{fwd}}(T)\big]
\;=\;
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}\!\big[\,\mathbb{E}_u^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[S_T]\,\big]
\;=\;
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[S_T]
\;=\;
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T).
$$

Thus $$ \{F_u^{\text{fwd}}(T)\} $$ is a $$ \mathbb{Q}^T $$-martingale.

---

### 4) Specializing to $$u=T$$

At maturity, the fair forward price **equals the spot** (no time left, no carry):
$$
F_T^{\text{fwd}}(T) \;=\; S_T.
$$

Therefore,
$$
F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T)
\;=\;
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[\,S_T\,]
\;=\;
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}\!\big[F_T^{\text{fwd}}(T)\big].
$$

This is exactly the martingale statement you wanted.

---

### ‚úÖ Takeaway
- Using $$P(\cdot,T)$$ as num√©raire makes $$F^{\text{fwd}}(\cdot,T)$$ a **martingale** under $$ \mathbb{Q}^T $$.
- The identity
  $$
  F_t^{\text{fwd}}(T) \;=\; \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}\!\big[F_T^{\text{fwd}}(T)\big]
  $$
  follows immediately from the **tower property** and the terminal condition $$F_T^{\text{fwd}}(T)=S_T$$.


---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Futures Price Definition

The **futures price** is the expectation under the **futures measure**:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^{fut}}[S_T],
$$

with the **money-market account (daily rebalanced)** as num√©raire.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Relating Forward and Futures Measures

To compare **forwards** and **futures**, we need to switch probability measures.

- The **forward measure** $\mathbb{Q}^T$ uses the **zero-coupon bond $P(t,T)$** as num√©raire.  
- The **futures measure** $\mathbb{Q}^{fut}$ uses the **money-market account rebalanced daily** as num√©raire.

By the **change-of-num√©raire theorem**, expectations under one measure can be expressed under another using a **Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative** (stochastic discount factor).  

For any payoff $X_T$, the relationship is:

$$
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^{fut}}[X_T]
=
\frac{\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}\!\big[X_T \cdot M_T \big]}
     {\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]},
$$

where:

- $\mathbb{Q}$ = risk-neutral measure (num√©raire = money market account without daily reset),  
- $M_T$ = stochastic discount factor that accounts for the change from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathbb{Q}^{fut}$.

Applying this to $S_T$ gives:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^{fut}}[S_T]
= \frac{\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T \cdot M_T]}{\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]}.
$$

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Expansion Around the Forward Price

Now expand the numerator using the **definition of covariance**:

$$
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T \cdot M_T]
= \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T] \cdot \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]
+ \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T).
$$

Plugging this back:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T)
= \frac{ \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T] \cdot \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]
+ \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T) }
{\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]}.
$$


$$
F_t^{fut}(T)
= \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T]
+ \frac{ \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T) }
       { \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T] }.
$$

Simplify:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[S_T]
+ \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T).
$$

:::note

### Normalization of $$M_T$$

Now, the trick:

- If we define $$M_T$$ as the **Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative** of $$\mathbb{Q}^{fut}$$ relative to $$\mathbb{Q}$$,  
  then by construction:

$$
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T] = 1.
$$

- In that case, the denominator disappears, and we get the simplified (but slightly abusive) form:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) =
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[S_T]
+ \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T).
$$

---

### Conclusion

- **Full general form (always true):**

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) =
F_t^{fwd}(T) + 
\frac{\text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T)}{\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]}.
$$

- **Simplified form (if $$M_T$$ normalized so that $$E[M_T]=1$$):**

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) =
F_t^{fwd}(T) + \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T).
$$

So the missing denominator was not ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù ‚Äî it was absorbed by the assumption that $$M_T$$ is already normalized.

:::

:::info

But:

$$
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}^T}[S_T] = F_t^{fwd}(T).
$$

Hence:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) \;\approx\; F_t^{fwd}(T) \;+\; \text{Cov}_t\big(S_T, \text{discount factors}\big).
$$

:::note
## ‚ùì Why Do We Often See
$$
F_t^{fut}(T) \;\approx\; F_t^{fwd}(T) + \text{Cov}_t(S_T, \text{discount factors}) \, ?
$$

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ General Formula

From the change-of-num√©raire argument, the exact relation is:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) =
F_t^{fwd}(T) \;+\;
\frac{\text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T)}
     {\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T]}.
$$

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Normalization of $$M_T$$

If $$M_T$$ is defined as the **Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative** of the futures measure relative to $$\mathbb{Q}$$, then by construction:

$$
\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}[M_T] = 1.
$$

So the formula simplifies to:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) =
F_t^{fwd}(T) + \text{Cov}_t^{\mathbb{Q}}(S_T, M_T).
$$

:::note

# Radon‚ÄìNikodym Derivative of the Futures Measure Relative to $$Q$$

## 1. Background on Change of Measure
In mathematical finance, a **change of measure** allows us to switch between probability measures associated with different numeraires.  

- Let $$Q^N$$ be the probability measure associated with numeraire $$N_t$$.  
- Let $$Q^M$$ be the probability measure associated with numeraire $$M_t$$.  

The Radon‚ÄìNikodym (RN) derivative between them is given by:
$$
\frac{dQ^{M}}{dQ^{N}}_{\mathcal F_t}
= \frac{M_t/N_t}{M_0/N_0}.
$$

This formula ensures that discounted asset prices remain martingales under the new measure.

---

## 2. Risk-Neutral Measure $$Q$$
The **risk-neutral measure** $$Q$$ is defined with respect to the **money-market account** (or bank account) $$B_t$$, where:
$$
B_t = e^{\int_0^t r_s \, ds}.
$$

Thus, $$Q$$ is the measure associated with the numeraire $$B_t$$.

---

## 3. Futures Measure
The **futures measure** is also defined with respect to the **money-market account** as numeraire. This is because the mark-to-market nature of futures contracts effectively removes discounting, and the bank account serves as the natural numeraire.

Therefore:
$$
Q^{\text{fut}} \equiv Q.
$$

---

## 4. Radon‚ÄìNikodym Derivative: Futures Measure vs. $$Q$$
Since both the risk-neutral measure and the futures measure use the **same numeraire** ($$B_t$$), the two measures coincide. Hence, their Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative is simply:

$$
\left.\frac{dQ^{\text{fut}}}{dQ}\right|_{\mathcal F_t} = 1, 
\qquad \forall t.
$$

---

## 5. Comparison: Forward Measure Case
If instead we considered the **$$T$$-forward measure** $$Q^T$$ (with zero-coupon bond $$P(t,T)$$ as numeraire), then relative to $$Q$$ we have:

$$
\left.\frac{dQ^{T}}{dQ}\right|_{\mathcal F_t}
= \frac{B_t\,P(0,T)}{B_0\,P(t,T)}.
$$

This highlights the difference:  
- Futures measure = identical to $$Q$$.  
- Forward measure = different from $$Q$$, with RN derivative given above.

---

## 6. Conclusion
- For the **futures measure**, the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative relative to $$Q$$ is **1 everywhere**.  
- For the **forward measure**, the RN derivative takes a non-trivial form depending on the bank account and bond prices.
:::

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why the "‚âà" (Approximation)

Even with normalization, people often write:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) \;\approx\; F_t^{fwd}(T) + \text{Cov}_t(S_T, \text{discount factors}).
$$

for two reasons:

1. **Interpretation shortcut**  
   Instead of carrying the exact Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative $$M_T$$, practitioners talk loosely about "discount factors".  
   The covariance term then becomes a heuristic link between stochastic interest rates and futures/forwards difference.

2. **Small adjustment**  
   In practice, the convexity adjustment is typically **small** (especially for short maturities or low rate vol).  
   So the covariance term is treated as a *correction* to the forward price ‚Äî hence the "‚âà".

---

### ‚úÖ Key Point

- If $$E[M_T]=1$$, the formula is **exact**.  
- The "‚âà" is used in textbooks and interviews to emphasize that the **main driver is the covariance term**, while the correction is usually of **second order**.  
- For long maturities and high interest rate volatility, this adjustment becomes significant.


:::


---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation

- If **$S_T$ and discount factors are uncorrelated** ‚Üí the covariance term vanishes and $F_t^{fut}(T) = F_t^{fwd}(T)$.
- If **$S_T$ is positively correlated with interest rates**:
  - When $S_T$ is high, interest rates are also high ‚Üí discount factors are small.
  - This **boosts futures prices** relative to forwards.
- If **$S_T$ is negatively correlated with rates** ‚Üí adjustment goes the other way.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

The **convexity adjustment** originates from this covariance term:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) - F_t^{fwd}(T)
= \text{Cov}_t \big( S_T , \text{discount factors} \big).
$$

This is why under stochastic interest rates, futures are **not equal** to forwards.

:::

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Intuition

- **Forward = single payment at maturity.**  
  Discounting applies once, at $$T$$.  

- **Future = daily settlements.**  
  Gains are received early and reinvested. Losses are paid early.  

If gains tend to occur when interest rates are high ‚Üí futures are more valuable.  
If gains occur when rates are low ‚Üí futures are less valuable.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Interest Rate Futures

For **Eurodollar futures**, the convexity adjustment is well-known.  
If forward rate is $$F_t$$, then futures rate is approximately:

$$
F_t^{\text{fut}} \approx F_t^{\text{fwd}} + \tfrac{1}{2} \, \sigma_r^2 \, (T-t)^2.
$$

Here the adjustment is always **positive** because higher rates increase reinvestment returns.

---




## ‚úÖ Summary

- For deterministic rates:  
  $$ F^{\text{fut}} = F^{\text{fwd}}. $$

- For stochastic rates:  
  $$ F^{\text{fut}} = F^{\text{fwd}} + \text{Convexity Adjustment}. $$

- The adjustment depends on the **correlation between asset price and rates**.  
- Critical in pricing **interest-rate futures** (Eurodollar, SOFR) and in risk management.

---
![Convexity Adjustment](./yields.png)

On that convexity bias graph, the ‚ÄúYield %‚Äù on the x-axis refers to a deterministic fixed rate (like a quoted yield-to-maturity or short-term risk-free rate used for discounting)

## üîÑ Forward vs Futures Convexity: Yield vs Time

Convexity effects can look *opposite* depending on whether we vary the **yield** or the **time-to-maturity**.  
Let‚Äôs reconcile the two perspectives.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Forward as a Function of Yield

For a fixed maturity $$T$$, the forward price is:

$$
F_t^{fwd}(T) = S_t \, e^{(r-q)(T-t)}.
$$

- As a function of the yield $$r$$, this is **exponential**.  
- Exponentials are convex in $$r$$.  

So, in a **Price vs Yield** graph:

- **Forward = convex curve**.  
- **Futures = linear** (since daily settlement eliminates discounting).  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Futures as a Function of Time

Now consider maturity $$T$$ increasing with **stochastic rates**.  
The futures price differs from the forward due to a covariance term:

$$
F_t^{fut}(T) = F_t^{fwd}(T) + \text{Cov}_t \big(S_T, M_T\big),
$$

where $$M_T$$ is the stochastic discount factor.

- If $$S_T$$ and $$M_T$$ are positively correlated, this term is **positive**.  
- The effect **grows with time** (longer horizon = more accumulated covariance).  

So, in a **Price vs Time** graph:

- **Futures = convex curve above forwards**.  
- **Forward = baseline curve**.  

![Convexity Adjustment](./forwards_vs_futures_time.png)


---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reconciling the Two Views

- **In Yield Space (fix $$T$$):**  
  Convexity comes from the exponential discount factor.  
  ‚Üí **Forward is convex**, futures is linear.  

- **In Time Space (fix stochastic $$r_t$$):**  
  Convexity comes from correlation between underlying and discounting.  
  ‚Üí **Futures are convex-adjusted**, forwards are the baseline.  

---

‚úÖ **Key Insight:**  
Convexity is about **curvature of expectations**.  
Which contract (forward vs futures) looks convex depends on whether you look across **yields** or across **time horizons**.
